This is my House Trends Program

When you run the program you will be prompted to select a database using the explorer.

Once you have selected the database, type in a postcode or partial postcode and press search or press enter on your
keyboard

Once the results have come onto the screen, then you can click the chart button and show a scatter graph of the house
prices.
